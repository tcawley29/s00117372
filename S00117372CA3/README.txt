Completed all tasks fully apart from: 
•	For each Product indicate the Supplier of that Product. This can be done by displaying the Supplier summary in a Tooltip, or by clicking to reveal a panel containing the information. Or devise a mechanism of your own that doesn't involve leaving the page. Invoke this lookup using Ajax.
•	For each Product when clicked, have a partial view rendered on the same page (e.g. at the bottom) with a list of 3 Orders (not OrderDetail) that contain that Product. The 3 Orders selected must represent those Orders with the greatest quantity of the selected Product.

----------------------------------------
On Task One listed, I was having problems with ajax and getting compiler errors so I said it was best to just leave it out and call it a day with what I had done.

On The Second Task I had listed I managed to display the detail as requested, however no matter what I tried I could not get it to display on the same page. I have the feature working on a new page when you click the details button in a row.
